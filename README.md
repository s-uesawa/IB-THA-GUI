This GUI program was created for evaluating tephra fall hazards based on database of Isopach maps (prototype version) by Shimpei Uesawa using R-Shiny with R-studio. https://s-uesawa.shinyapps.io/IB-THA-GUI/

Original script and source data is available at https://github.com/s-uesawa/Prototype-TephraDB-Japan and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3608345.
A detailed explanation is available at Uesawa et al. (2022) https://doi.org/10.1186/s13617-022-00126-x.

The coordinate ranges handled in this database are as follows:
125E/150E/25N/47N (JGD2000)

When you use this application, please download raster and related data from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5109160, and put the data into "data" folder.
