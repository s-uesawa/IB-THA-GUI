We created this GUI program for assessing tephra fall hazards based on a database of Isopach maps (prototype version) by Shimpei Uesawa using R-Shiny with R-studio.
The original script and source data are available at https://github.com/s-uesawa/Prototype-TephraDB-Japan and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3608345.
A detailed explanation is available at Uesawa et al. (2022) https://doi.org/10.1186/s13617-022-00126-x.
The coordinate ranges handled in this database are as follows:
125E/150E/25N/47N (JGD2000)

R is a free software environment for statistical computation and graphics (Visit https://www.r-project.org/ for more detail ).
